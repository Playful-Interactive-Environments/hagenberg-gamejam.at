      Now that the earthlings took on their quest to colonize space, it's time to strike back before they arrive.

      Grab your biggest asteroid blaster and destroy their space travel innovations.

      But be careful: make sure to keep the earth-destroying oil facilities alive.

      If climate change comes faster than their space rocket, you can outlive them!
