      As a little girl, you will fight against monsters to prove to your father that you are already grown up.
      You start close to midnight but you must return to your home before midnight or your mother will be very angry.

      Enjoy the beautiful graphics and the action in those fights.

      Let yourself be surprised at the end.

      You are a vampire that was kidnapped by a blood cult. You awake, mortally wounded, in a cave surrounded by cultists. They want to sacrifice you to their dark god, you want to live. In compromise you slaughter them.

      But the only weapon you currently possess is your own blood. You lose blood, and come closer to death, with every second that passes and attacking your foes only weakens you further. But luckily you are a vampire and can restock your blood reserves by draining blood from fallen enemies.

      Now you have to fight your way out of the cults cozy home cave but beware of traps, pentagrams, and the fanatic followers of the EVIL CULT LEADER.

      Now that the earthlings took on their quest to colonize space, it's time to strike back before they arrive.

      Grab your biggest asteroid blaster and destroy their space travel innovations.

      But be careful: make sure to keep the earth-destroying oil facilities alive.

      If climate change comes faster than their space rocket, you can outlive them!
