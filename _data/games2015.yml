      It's Christmas time. Time of joy, happiness and Chaos.

      Pickup a controller and become a house! Or Santa's sledge! Cooperate with your teammate and together bring down enemy team. Fly with sledge to gather presents and fill the chimney of your house with presents. Shoot presents with your cannons! Kick down enemy house.

      Watch out for the special present! Send it down the chimney and laugh at the enemy trying to get you... their powers ain't gonna work no more.

      But beware! Both families living inside houses are hungry for presents. There is nothing you can do about it. Just pray they go to sleep!

      In this game you are playing a light fairy, who is trying to free her forest from dark shadow creatures that have taken over. The fairy encounters shadow monsters and tries to defeat them. The more creatures she beats, the more light is returning to the forest and her powers grow.

      She can decide whether to plant flowers of light and regain more attack power or increase her inner light to strengthen her defences. When she has defeated as many monsters as possible, she will be strong enough to face the evil necromancer responsible for plunging the forest into darkness.

      Battle against your friends to become the Magnomaster in the year 3000. Your power (magnetic attraction and repulsion) does not work on your enemies, but merely on your metal surroundings. Push or pull

      * arrows out of their contraption to shoot them through the level,
      * spikes out of their base in order to make the ground more deadly,
      * metal crates onto your enemies to shove them into traps and lava.

      Activate the ridiculously oversized Deathulum by pushing one of the red buttons. Everything in its path will be slashed! Last man standing wins the round.

      3.. 2.. 1.. MAGNETIZE!

      Fight against the boss by destroying his "Exo-parts".

      Only colored "Exo-Parts" will take damage. Your bullets have to have the same color as the part you want to attack. To change the color of your bullets pick up other weapons (they spawn randomly).

      When all the Parts are destroyed the boss implodes. But then he rise again: bigger and with more weapons. Avoid hostile bullets and lasers AND REACH A NEW HIGHSCORE!

      wo super-humans are duking it out in a post-apocalyptic world. But there is one problem. There are not able to kill each other. Even though their powers are able to destroy solid stone walls and tear mere mortals into pieces within a fraction of a second, when faced against each other, these powers are reduced to simple pushes.

      So they continue to fight while the world around them falls apart, both of them yearning for the day they will finally be able to rest. Till then they will just continue to push each other into lava.

      A giant robot has destroyed the city's centre. The protagonist has to save the day and power off the evil flying robot by pressing its power switch while evading the mechanic deathmachine's deadly attacks on the way by switching his own powers.

      On his way through the devastated city streets, the player must dodge the robot's deadly color ball projectiles. Those color balls come in three colors:

      * RED – superfast
      * GREEN – able to penetrate through objects
      * BLUE – bounce back from objects

      In order to survive, the player can hide behind many scattered objects or use his ability to dodge bullets: If he becomes Red, the player is not affected by Red balls (same for Green and Blue). In addition, he gains a color-specific ability:

      * RED – faster running
      * GREEN – higher jump with air control
      * BLUE – Walljump
