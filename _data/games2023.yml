      The cats have had enough of the invading electronic (and water-shooting) devices in their lives. They are loud, big, and scary. So, the strongest cat embarks on a journey to destroy the power source of their enemies. The player must travel through three areas and defeat the natural enemies of cats like vacuums, water hoses, and finally, the electronic panel controlling the city's power. After each battle, they can choose from three items to make them stronger; some combinations even unlock secret, powerful variations.

      The main character in this game is a loyal servant of Santa Claus. Just before Christmas, evil robots have stolen the presents. Santa has commanded the retrieval of these presents to save Christmas. The story unfolds with the main character pursuing the robots to a small village where the presents are hidden. The mission is to return all the presents before Christmas, and there is only a 10-minute window to accomplish this task. A significant challenge is that the character's only ability is to transform into a present to evade the robots. However, players must be cautious as this ability has a cooldown period. It is imperative to avoid being caught by the robots. The goal is to save as many presents as possible.
