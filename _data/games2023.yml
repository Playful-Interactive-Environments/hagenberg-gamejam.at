      The cats have had enough of the invading electronic (and water-shooting) devices in their lives. They are loud, big, and scary. So, the strongest cat embarks on a journey to destroy the power source of their enemies. The player must travel through three areas and defeat the natural enemies of cats like vacuums, water hoses, and finally, the electronic panel controlling the city's power. After each battle, they can choose from three items to make them stronger; some combinations even unlock secret, powerful variations.

      Postlair is a game about delivering packages to the right houses. You control the _BesAir_ delivery truck and have to shoot a package into the marked properties. As soon as you have delivered all packages, you must return to the post office to complete the day. In the office, you may buy upgrades with coins you can collect along the way. Each day, your remaining time will be converted into your score and added to your total score. Each day will get harder until you run out of time, at which point you will see your final score.
