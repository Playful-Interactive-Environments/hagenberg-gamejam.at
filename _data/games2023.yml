      The cats have had enough of the invading electronic (and water-shooting) devices in their lives. They are loud, big, and scary. So, the strongest cat embarks on a journey to destroy the power source of their enemies. The player must travel through three areas and defeat the natural enemies of cats like vacuums, water hoses, and finally, the electronic panel controlling the city's power. After each battle, they can choose from three items to make them stronger; some combinations even unlock secret, powerful variations.

      The main character in this game is a loyal servant of Santa Claus. Just before Christmas, evil robots have stolen the presents. Santa has commanded the retrieval of these presents to save Christmas. The story unfolds with the main character pursuing the robots to a small village where the presents are hidden. The mission is to return all the presents before Christmas, and there is only a 10-minute window to accomplish this task. A significant challenge is that the character's only ability is to transform into a present to evade the robots. However, players must be cautious as this ability has a cooldown period. It is imperative to avoid being caught by the robots. The goal is to save as many presents as possible.

      Mean robots that are insulting everyone have taken over the world. Only you are brave enough to defend your honor in this reaction game. The game has 2 levels with 4 enemies each, increasing in difficulty. Additionally, a PvP mode allows you to play against your friends. To win the game, you need to press W (P for Player 2) faster than your opponent once the Exclamation Mark appears on the screen.  If both you and your opponent press at the same time, you enter Clash mode, in which the winner is decided by whoever can press their button more often within 3 seconds. You lose immediately if you press your button before the exclamation mark appears.

      In the game 'Tunder Muffin GmbH,' you join three employees on their quest to avoid being fired. To boost productivity, they need to enhance their skills using small robots, ultimately aiming to defeat the ultimate office boss. The goal of this game is to level up the three employees by using helper robots, enabling them to defeat the final boss, the MEAN Printer. This auto-battle/strategy balance game not only tests players' strategic thinking but also demands quick decision-making and reflexes. When you kill a robot, the employee takes over the stats from the robot. Make them as strong as possible, but don't kill your own employees. A smart balance is important for a strong robot, but not too strong to kill one of the employees.
