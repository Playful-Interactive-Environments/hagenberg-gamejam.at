      A Skydiving adventure with friends goes horribly wrong because they secretly want to kill each other.

      In the beginning one of four unique jet packs (unicorn, reindeer, dragon or elephant) can be chosen. Each player steers a skydiver and tries to push the other players into the dangerous obstacles. The players are connected, thus they have to be careful not to steer themselves into the obstacles or let themselves be crushed to a horrible death.

      Your goal is to transport as many people as you can without letting them die. Hover over one person with the mouse and click 1, 2 or 3 on your keyboard to make them go to the elevator of your choice. But be careful! An elevator can only carry a maximum of 8 people. If you overfill an elevator it will crash (UNITED WE FALL). The game is lost when one elevator crashes.

      AVOID THE CHICKEN! If you see a chicken, DON'T let them run into it! It will explode and kill people around it! You can avoid the chickens by clicking on the people, making them stop for a few seconds. But be careful! A person can only handle two clicks. After the third click they will die.

      The annual tournament has started again! Two tribes, the Hogs and the Rams, are fighting again for respect, honor and glory. Join one of the tribes and help them to succeed by carrying a
      Balldragon into the enemy goal. But beware: the Balldragon is a fragile creature, if you get too close to a teammate while carrying it, it will literally explode (enemies, on the other
      hand, won´t startle it at all)! Also, watch your step: the tournament is held on a plateau high up in the mountains, so don´t fall. And don´t even dare throwing the sacred Balldragon
      from the plateau: thunder god Goatdin himself will otherwise punish you with his thunderbolts!

      Two deleted computer files fight for their lives. They were just deleted, but wouldn't let go, so the computer god "ROMney" put them in a cage to fight. The winner gets restored. Souls from other deleted files are passing by and are used by the two opponents to shield themselves, as well as to attack their opponent. To get restored, both have to die by colliding into one another, but the one, who holds more souls at that point will be restored.

      One out of three jellyfish has an infection. It has to touch another one to pass it on. The healthy jellyfish can collect the pickup boni spawned by the infected jellyfish to gain points. They can also bump into each other to create a wave that throws back the infected jellyfish. All jellyfish naturally attract each other and can further pull in boni by blinging up.

      The goal is to collect as many points as possible. Points are gained from picking up bonus objects, hitting another healthy jellyfish or giving the infection to another jellyfish when infected.
