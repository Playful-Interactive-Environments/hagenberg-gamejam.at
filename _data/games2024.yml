      Inspired by classic LucasArts point-and-click adventure games, Der Herr Lumpus follows a child who believes he is an adult. Imitating his perception of adult behavior, the story explores a day in his life as someone who thinks he is a tax consultant (Steuerberater) — or at least he thinks he is. The idea for Der Herr Lumpus originated from a pen-and-paper campaign we played, where Herr Lumpus became a standout character. His childlike mind and unique perspective on how children view the adult world made him the perfect protagonist for our game. The game is a short, pixel-art point-and-click adventure that captures the nostalgic charm of LucasArts titles like Monkey Island. Players interact using the left mouse button to look around, click on objects, and solve puzzles.

It's Christmas, and you are visiting your distant family - literally, in this case - and the drive is long and boring. Luckily, you brought your Digi-Box to keep you entertained! Unluckily, you get awfully sick on long car drives. Your goal: Beat your boredom, but also DON'T puke in Dad's new car (again) and get to the Christmas party. Beware! Some things can help with your nausea, but others aren't good at all...

Fight against them trying to reach you by feeding them your world-famous "sticky noodles" from your noodle maker gun. As the name implies, your noodles are also sticky enough to help you get across obstacles, which might, sadly, be too much for your old limbs to handle on their own.
