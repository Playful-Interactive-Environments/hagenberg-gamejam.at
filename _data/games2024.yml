      You are a kid sitting in the back of the car, your parents in the front seats. It's Christmas, and you are visiting your distant family - literally, in this case - and the drive is long and boring. Luckily, you brought your Digi-Box to keep you entertained! Unluckily, you get awfully sick on long car drives. Your goal: Beat your boredom, but also DON'T puke in Dad's new car (again) and get to the Christmas party. Beware! Some things can help with your nausea, but others aren't good at all...

      In "Pasta from the Blasta," you play the role of an elderly woman. Your grandchildren try to put you into a retirement home, but you still have some fight left in you! Fight against them trying to reach you by feeding them your world-famous "sticky noodles" from your noodle maker gun. As the name implies, your noodles are also sticky enough to help you get across obstacles, which might, sadly, be too much for your old limbs to handle on their own.
