      You are a cat and your owner has neglected you for too long, so it's time for revenge! Cause as much mayhem as you can before the alarm clock wakes him up. While you're redecorating the room always keep an eye on the clock. If the timer is close to zero, punch the clock to press the snooze button, for it will give you additional time! Now go and do your duty as a vengeful cat!

      Space Engineer Nole got a last minute assignment: Fix the rocket while the countdown goes down and the rocket starts. Unfortunately the rocket is so rusty, that it continues to break - so don't stop hammering and fixing stuff because more repairing means more points! First Nole has to find one of the problems (could be a broken wing, tank, pipe, engine, ...), then fix it with the according tool. On the console at the bottom he can see how much time he has left.
