      The bodybuilder and artist pair Igor and Anastasia are trying to fix their fusebox in the dark without destroying their entire home. This game is intended as a co-op experience where communication is critical!

      One player controls the game while the other has to guide them using the included document. The goal of the controlling player is to navigate a dark house and reach the goal while trying not to break anything and describe the environment to the advising player. The advising player's goal is to communicate with the controlling player, warn them of any breakable objects they might encounter, and help them solve small puzzles.

      Both players have to communicate with each other to make it through the game successfully. It is recommended that the advising player doesn't look at the game screen during gameplay for the intended experience.

      Cyberspace is a fast-paced bullet-hell shoot-'em-up created with Unity. You have to move, dodge, teleport, and shoot your way to the final boss. But to earn upgrades, you must first defeat the whole wave and then choose between a random selection.

      Instead of making the experience gradually more difficult over time, the idea was (relating to the game jam topic) that the game should reward players if they complete a level successfully. So they can get the opportunity with every single attempt to use their knowledge about the enemy patterns and boss fights, but with even more powerful equipment.

      But even that won’t stop you. If you die, just alter your past as a ghost, return to your body and keep going. Prevent your body from dying by moving cover, distracting enemies, or simply exterminating the threat.

      So you somehow landed on this unearthly planet. It's weird, but you feel like you should definitely venture out to find secret objects hidden in the scene. That turns out to be a challenge, given that your vision becomes super trippy every time you find one.

      But don't worry, the strange planet you are on is not hostile; it actually helps you: the colors of the environment become warmer the closer you get to your goal and colder the further you get away from it.
