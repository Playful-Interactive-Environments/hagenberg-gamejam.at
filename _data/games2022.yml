      In this game, you play as an aspiring guardian "angel" with a questionable moral compass. Your main objective is to protect the cute grandmas while they are crossing the street (they have very poor vision :/ ). For every evil car you smite (including the passengers), extra points can be earned. Smashing two cars together gives you a big bonus! But be careful not to harm pedestrian elders!

      The game is about an employee of a certain furniture store named Ekia. He is really good at being bad at his job because he is extremely introverted and avoids any customer interaction. However, to not lose his job, he has to complete several tasks throughout the day, like taking boxes from the pickup spot to the warehouse or taking care of accidents involving fake toilets. As he tries to complete his daily tasks, customers chase him, trying to get help from the employee. To get away, he can do actions like throwing cans of soda pop at them, or even hauling their children through the air, as this momentarily stuns them. 
      
      Listen for the enthusiastic Ekia colleagues that give you new tasks over the intercom!

      You most certainly know the feeling when you've got a terrible day and just want to destroy everything. Your world is dark, and you can't escape. These days, talking to people or trying to walk to the colorful side is not recommended. This is the perfect moment to resign and release your raw emotions. You may find out that you still feel empty after destroying all there is to destroy. Not till then is the time right to finally walk to the bright side again. Thus, nobody wants to stay long in that angry state; you should get to the colorful side as soon as possible. If things seem too high to reach, just try holding on. Possibly, Bernd feels the same way.
